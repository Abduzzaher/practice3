                age. Need proof? Look no further than the 15 amazing kids highlighted here, each of whom is doing his or

            <h1 class="banner-heading">1. DALIYAH MARIE ARANA</h1>
            <p class="banner-description text-justify">Studies show that the typical American will read around five
                books per year. Well, 5-year-old Daliyah
                Marie Arana of Gainesville, Georgia, does that in a week. What's more impressive: She read more than
                1000 books before she even entered kindergarten. Her love of reading became so prolific that it caught
                the attention of the Library of Congress, where she was invited to serve as Guest Librarian in January
                2017.


                “I want to inspire all the kids at my school to read more,” Arana tells Mental Floss. “I read to my
                5-month-old baby brother, Demetrio, every day because I want him to learn to read before age 2!”

                That same passion extends to her community, where Arana says, “I want to work with my mom to make my
                school the best group of readers in Georgia!” —Jay Serafino</p>

            <h1 class="banner-heading">2. GISELLE BAZOS</h1>
            <p class="banner-description text-justify">Nine-year-old Giselle Bazos has solved a problem that plagues
                kids her age: lost retainers. Her
                invention, the Retainer Container, prevents kids from losing their dental appliances while they eat. “I
                have a retainer that I lost a couple times,” Bazos tells Mental Floss. “I found it really hard,
                especially when you are eating, to keep it somewhere where it won’t get thrown away or broken.”



                Her storage container can be worn on the wrist, so that a kid’s retainer never actually leaves their
                person. (Which is good news for parents, too, as it can cost as much as $600 to replace a lost
                retainer.) Bazos got to present her idea at the National Invention Convention and Entrepreneurship Expo
                in the summer of 2017. Though right now she’s more focused on being a regular fourth grader than
                manufacturing the device, we’ll be looking out for her next brilliant invention. —Shaunacy Ferro</p>

            <h1 class="banner-heading">3. ROBBIE BOND</h1>
            <p class="banner-description text-justify">This past April, the president issued two executive orders that
                hit close to home for 9-year-old Robbie
                Bond. They threatened the protected status of 27 national monuments, including Papahānaumokuākea Marine
                National Monument in Bond’s home state of Hawaii. He knew he had to do something, so with his family he
                decided to hit the road. Bond's mission is to visit each of the 27 vulnerable monuments while raising
                awareness of the issue among both kids and adults. He’s already well on his way to achieving that goal,
                and tracks his progress on his website, Kids Speak for Parks.



                “I love when I visit schools and interact with my peers and they tell me about their experiences
                visiting national parks and monuments,” Bond tells Mental Floss. “At every National Monument I have
                visited, the community has welcomed me and people have taken the time to educate me about the uniqueness
                and significance of each monument.” —Michele Debczak</p>
